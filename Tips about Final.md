As you know, the DSAA final papers are strictly protected and will be submitted to the teacher after the exam. 
I won’t explicitly tell you what problems were tested on our final, but I can offer some tips to help with your review:

1. **Review Previous Quizzes & Midterm**

Our final exam included a problem that was exactly the same as one from a previous quiz. Make sure to review these materials. 
You can also find useful resources here: [DSAA Exam Resources](https://github.com/NYH-Dolphin/SUSTech-Course-Info/tree/main/CS203%20Data%20Structure%20and%20Algorithm%20Analysis/Exam)

2. **Do Extra Exercises**

If possible, try to solve additional problems. 
One of the questions on our final was much easier if you’re familiar with Dynamic Programming. Platforms like Leetcode can be helpful for practice.

3. **Cheating Paper**

My cheating paper is not that applicable, don't just straightly copy from it.
When you want to get A or higher, you should put less solid knowledge on cheating paper, more details e.g. in KMP, how these two pointers react when mismatch.

4. **Prepare for Speed and Accuracy**

I didn’t manage to finish all the problems (around 12 points worth) during the final because there were a lot of questions. 
Make sure to prepare in a way that allows you to balance accuracy with speed.
